# **Amazon Open Search Service**

## **Getting Open Search**

### The Amazon Open Search service is free to [download](https://opensearch.org/). The open source project from AWS is an offshoot of the Apache 2.0 licensed Elasticsearch 7.10.2 & Kibana 7.10.2 comprising of A search engine daemon, Kibana visualization and Dashboards. Setting up the Open search service and limiting access with Cognito User pool can be a daunting task. In this blog, I would be discussing on how to leverage the Lambda to run SQL Plugin to run smart queries to get data from the Open Search database.

## **Documentation**

### If you don't understand something about this service, the [extensive documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest) is a great place to look for answers.

## **Support**
### For those without premium support access, you can utilize the [repost.aws](repost.aws) blog to ask questions on any AWS services you may be facing issues with.

## **This Repository**
### This repository contains an absrtaciton of my experience with using the API Gateway to trigger Lambda serverless functions that queried the Open Search service endpoint. Feel free to raise an issue if you find a problem with my approach.
